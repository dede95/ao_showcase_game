            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there, Iâ€™m Adeola ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m a born and bred Londoner and data scientist with a knack for the colourful and exciting.
                I believe in keeping this simple and fun. Whether Iâ€™m tinkering with data, playing around with
                designs, taking a workshop on creative coding or just figuring out what to learn next, Iâ€™m
                always looking for ways to try out something new.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Iâ€™m not working, you can find me dancing in a studio, enjoying live music or at an arts
                 exhibition. Iâ€™m all about enjoying life and enjoying it with others and I hope I can express
                 that in the work I do too. 
            </p>

            <h2>Why web development?</h2>
            <p>
                Iâ€™ve always been interested in the idea of creating something that people can interact with and use. Coming from a data science background and 
                having creative instincts, Iâ€™m all about problem solving and making sense of complex information. 
                What excites me about web development is bringing these aspects together and bringing ideas to life in a functional and user friendly way. 
                Iâ€™m also drawn to web development because itâ€™ll allow me to see my work in action, whether itâ€™s a sleek and responsive design or a useful 
                feature that would make someoneâ€™s day easier. I also look forward to working with others on projects that will be useful to others.
            </p>
            <p>
                As someone who enjoys learning new things, getting into an ever evolving field would keep my interests alive and I look forward to picking 
                up a new technology and diving into it. Whether thatâ€™s using data for a machine learning tool with a front end or designing a creative site that 
                uses creative coding libraries for an engaging experience, the possibilities of web development makes me excited to be a part of the industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Itâ€™s rewarding to know that I can possibly make an impact through code and building things on the web that can make someoneâ€™s day better.

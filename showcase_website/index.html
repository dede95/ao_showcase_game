            <p>
                Iâ€™m a born and bred Londoner and data scientist with a knack for the colourful and exciting.
                I believe in keeping this simple and fun. Whether Iâ€™m tinkering with data, playing around with
                designs, taking a workshop on creative coding or just figuring out what to learn next, Iâ€™m
                always looking for ways to try out something new.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Iâ€™m not working, you can find me dancing in a studio, enjoying live music or at an arts
                 exhibition. Iâ€™m all about enjoying life and enjoying it with others and I hope I can express
                 that in the work I do too. 
            </p>

            <h2>Why web development?</h2>
            <p>
                Iâ€™ve always been excited by the idea of creating something people can interact with and use. Coming from a data science background and having some learning
                 experience in design, I love problem-solving and making sense of complex information. What excites me about web development is that it brings my passions
                  together - allowing me to turn ideas into functional and user-friendly experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                What draws me in is the ability to see my work in action, whether itâ€™s a sleek, responsive design or features on a product that make someoneâ€™s
                 day a little easier. Iâ€™m eager to work collaboratively with other software developers on projects that have real world impact, building tools
                  and platforms that help others. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As someone who gets excited by learning new things, Iâ€™m excited to join a field that is constantly evolving. Whether thatâ€™s integrating machine
                 learning into a front-end tool or using creative coding libraries for engaging, interactive experiences, software engineering offers many for
                  me to get excited by and grow. Also knowing that my code can make an impact, whether big or small, motivates me to be a part of the industry.              </p>
